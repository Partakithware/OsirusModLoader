Does not run in eclipse, build update then pack into installer via installer build and run with official Launcher.

I am on Linux so I have included .sh for the builds, this whole thing is not far along please feel free to help, if you do help and code, add yourself to the main license!

That said, I will not be putting together any scripts for the builds on other OS's so please feel free to create them.

Editions will be separated per branch - for instance this is the 1.21.11-pre5 and so on.
